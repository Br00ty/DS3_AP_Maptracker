# Dark Souls III Map Tracker Pack for PopTracker

This is a Dark Souls III Map Tracker for PopTracker. Designed around the Archipelago version of the randomizer, setup for auto-tracking as well. 

## Installation

Download the latest release from the releases section, and then move it into `/poptracker/packs/` and you're all set!

## Connecting to AP

To connect to the AP server for auto-tracking, clik on `AP` button at the top of the tracker, a seperate window should pop up asking for you to "enter archipelago server port", in which you should type in `archipelago.gg:PORT_NUMBER` (or whatever ip/port combination you're connecting to), select `OK` and then continue to enter in your Slot name and the password to the room (if there is one). Once complete, the `AP` button at the top of the tracker window should turn "Green" meaning you are now auto-tracking!
