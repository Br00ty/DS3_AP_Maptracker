# Dark Souls III Map Tracker Pack for PopTracker

This is a Dark Souls III Map Tracker for PopTracker. Designed around the Archipelago version of the randomizer, setup for auto-tracking as well. 

## Installation

Download the latest release from the releases section, and then move it into `/poptracker/packs/` and you're all set!

## Connecting to AP

To connect to the AP server for auto-tracking, click on the `AP` button at the top of the tracker and a seperate window should pop up asking for you to "__enter archipelago server port__", in which you should type in `archipelago.gg:PORT_NUMBER` (or whatever ip/port combination you're connecting to), select `OK` and then continue to enter in your __Slot name__ and the __password__ to the room (if there is one). Once complete, the `AP` button at the top of the tracker window should turn "Green" meaning you are now auto-tracking!

## More Notes

__Iudex Gundyr__, __Coiled Sword__, and __Path of the Dragon__ are not randomized nor auto-tracked at this time. There are also two __Tower Keys__ at the moment; one being in the pool and one being in the shop, if you purchase the __Tower Key__ from the shop, it will not auto-track and you will have to select the __Tower Key__ on the item tracker yourself
